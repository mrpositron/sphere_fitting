# Sphere Fitting with Neural Guided RANSAC

## About

This project is a demonstration of a simple sphere fitting algorithm using a neural network to guide the RANSAC algorithm. The algorithm is based on the [NG-RANSAC algorithm](https://arxiv.org/abs/1905.04132) and is used to find the best fitting sphere to a set of points.
